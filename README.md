Here is a litle challenge!
Run the encryptor file and look for the newly generated key.txt
Try to write a file to decrypt all the encrypted files using that key.
If you failed, you're a BOZO!

Another challenge:
Try comparing the runtimes of all the files and find out which one is the fastest.
It will be C++.
Reason: Google it...
